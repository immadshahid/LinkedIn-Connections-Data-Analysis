# LinkedIn-Connections-Data-Analysis
I got my Connections data from Linkedin in the form of csv and performed a small data analysis task on it using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn and Numpy.

This provided me with insights of what are the top job positions in my overall Connections list. Also, I was able to see the companies in which my connections work. This can be improved further.
